[The Runes Workbook by Leon D. Wild](https://www.librarything.com/work/463242/book/38338754)

> Runes are not only a writing system used by some of the ancient Germanic peoples-they are also known as the Mysteries. Carved on wood, metal or stone, the rune staves (or stones) are a powerful divinatory tool, and are steeped in a rich folkloric tradition. The Runes Workbook provides illustrations throughout and a fascinating insight into these Mysteries including the history of the Runes, the significance of the runic poems and runic literature, the meanings of the individual staves, and methods for runic divination. The Runes Workbook also explores the connections between the Runes, mythology, archaeology and magic, and provides an insight into runic psychology for beginner and devotee alike.

**Day 1:** Conceptualize the game. See what can I make visually different from my classmates. I wanted to carry the theme of _The Odin_ throughout the projects im makin for this course. And maybe showcase it to my UX portfolio. learned so much about Norse Runes so that I can make somehow some justice to the game. Will try to finish the CSS for the UI so that I can focus on the game logic on ReactJS.

## The Odin Project - Intermediate JS project

Staying true the consisitency of the design system of The Odin Project, I decided to use Runes where it is more connected to Norse mythology that pokemons and/or starwars characters.

[The Runes Workbook by Leon D. Wild](https://www.librarything.com/work/463242/book/38338754)

> Runes are not only a writing system used by some of the ancient Germanic peoples-they are also known as the Mysteries. Carved on wood, metal or stone, the rune staves (or stones) are a powerful divinatory tool, and are steeped in a rich folkloric tradition. The Runes Workbook provides illustrations throughout and a fascinating insight into these Mysteries including the history of the Runes, the significance of the runic poems and runic literature, the meanings of the individual staves, and methods for runic divination. The Runes Workbook also explores the connections between the Runes, mythology, archaeology and magic, and provides an insight into runic psychology for beginner and devotee alike.

Found out that there are numerous types of react `hooks`. Im kinda skeptic if I can finish React in the rate Im understandng the concept behind it. Even the `hook` names does not conotes on something that will help me remember how to us it.

But still Im not losing hope on grasping the concepts behind each `hook`. Hopefully I can master it through making couple of projects more.

**Day 1:** Conceptualize the game. See what can I make visually different from my classmates. I wanted to carry the theme of _The Odin_ throughout the projects im makin for this course. And maybe showcase it to my UX portfolio. learned so much about Norse Runes so that I can make somehow some justice to the game. Done on the game assets. Will try to finish the CSS for the UI so that I can focus on the game logic on ReactJS.

**Day 2:** Struggled with `useEffect` and `useState`. Its hard to grab the idea that hooks are asynchronous and that it may not produce results as expected like common JS functions do. Need to focus more on hooks to master react. Im learning JS because I miss dealing with actioScript; which I think is the closest language compare to it.

**Day 3:** The game is actually simple, the design and hooks implementation took more time than coding the algorithm of the game. Im happy with the UI and the product itself. Simple yet entertaining to make. _Completed 29 April 2023_

**Day 4** Added support on mobile responsiveness.

## Challenges

1. Take a little bit of time to think about how you want to implement your application, the features you want to implement, which components you need, and how to structure your application. Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”, which shows the best score you achieved thus far. You also need a couple of cards that display images and possibly informational text. There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.

2. Now that you’ve thought about the structure of your application, set up the folder structure and start creating the components. We suggest you use functional components and therefore hooks in this project.

3. Style your application so you can show it off!

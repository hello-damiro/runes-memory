[The Runes Workbook by Leon D. Wild](https://www.librarything.com/work/463242/book/38338754)

> Runes are not only a writing system used by some of the ancient Germanic peoples-they are also known as the Mysteries. Carved on wood, metal or stone, the rune staves (or stones) are a powerful divinatory tool, and are steeped in a rich folkloric tradition. The Runes Workbook provides illustrations throughout and a fascinating insight into these Mysteries including the history of the Runes, the significance of the runic poems and runic literature, the meanings of the individual staves, and methods for runic divination. The Runes Workbook also explores the connections between the Runes, mythology, archaeology and magic, and provides an insight into runic psychology for beginner and devotee alike.

**Day 1:** Conceptualize the game. See what can I make visually different from my classmates. I wanted to carry the theme of _The Odin_ throughout the projects im makin for this course. And maybe showcase it to my UX portfolio. learned so much about Norse Runes so that I can make somehow some justice to the game. Done on the game assets. Will try to finish the CSS for the UI so that I can focus on the game logic on ReactJS.

## Challenges

1. Take a little bit of time to think about how you want to implement your application, the features you want to implement, which components you need, and how to structure your application. Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”, which shows the best score you achieved thus far. You also need a couple of cards that display images and possibly informational text. There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.

2. Now that you’ve thought about the structure of your application, set up the folder structure and start creating the components. We suggest you use functional components and therefore hooks in this project.

3. Style your application so you can show it off!
